# Tech Sales Trail

A single-file React-powered sales quarter simulator where you struggle against pipeline decay, burnout, PIPs, and random SaaS chaos. Your only goal: survive Q1 without being fired.

## Features
- 13-week tech sales simulation
- Energy, stress, cash, pipeline dynamics
- Prospecting, demos, proposals, closes
- Macro events: breaches, budget freezes, discount wars
- Full animated ASCII endings
- Pure single-page React with no build pipeline

## How to Run
Just download this repo (or visit the GitHub Pages link below) and open `index.html` in a browser.

## Future Plans
- Modularize engine logic
- Add AE scenarios
- Add CSM/renewals mode
- Real stats, dashboards, and visualizations
